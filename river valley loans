river valley loans cash advances are a form of short-term alternative financing. You receive a loan based on past credit and debit card sales and make daily or weekly payments based on future sales.

Since they’re not technically a loan, usury laws don’t apply, which means there are no limits on how much interest you can get charged. That’s why it’s possible to find yourself paying high interest rates, from 30 percent to 99 percent and up, with MCAs.
